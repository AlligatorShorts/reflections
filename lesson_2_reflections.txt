What happens when you initalize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    You create a hidden .git file, which doesnt interact with users to track the status of other files in the directories. You need to it
    so that you can start tracking commits, i.e. saved states, of the thing you are working on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    It is the inbetween area. the staging area is a pre-requisite for a file being saved in a commit. Practically, files are no different
    having been added or not. It offers the benefit of clarity, and only updating the files you need. Perhaps some files are completely
    finished and do not need to be touched. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    the staging area is an area easily seen with which you can check exactly what you are going to commit, and then decide if it is only
    one logical change. this makes things very clear for human users.
