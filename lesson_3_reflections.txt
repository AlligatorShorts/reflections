When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    a remote repository would act as good backup in case of local corruption of files. it also allows you (and others) to work on the
    project without geographical hinderance. Finally it centralises all your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
    there are a number of reasons why changes could be on GitHub that are ot useful to you. One, they could be put there accidentally 
    (human error). Two, you might not being working on an up-to-date part of the program, or off in a branch. Three, the new updates 
    might clash or hinder parts you've been working, and slow you down. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
    Forks are usually someone else's work, which you like/want/need but will modify. However, in 1) an efford to credit them and 2)
    with their knowledge that you are usuing their work, you can fork the work. this works oly via github. Clones are just copying a
    repository, and can be done within computer (i.e. changing file location) and computer to computer. This allows you to have an exact
    copy of the clone. Branches are seperations of the same work. They could be called 'alternative commits', in which changes are made
    independant of the master (branch) and create a different program.
